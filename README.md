# LovePrint
## What is it?
It's an internet connected receipt printer, intended to be run from a Raspberry Pi. It supports printing messages and drawings from around the world. 

The frontend is written with Vue 3 & Vuetify, with mobile-first design principles. It is deployed as a progressive web app (PWA) and can therefore be run on any device with an internet connection.

[The backend](https://github.com/LouisH98/loveprint-api) is written in Python with Flask & Flask-API as the REST API framework.

## Features

After clicking/tapping the add drawing button, a dialog appears where you can create your masterpieces! The pen size can be adjusted, and if any mistakes are made, there is also the ability to undo/redo the last modifications.

### Printing

After finishing the drawing, you can choose to remove or download the drawing, or add a message and send both over to the printer, where they will be immediately printed into a physical form!
